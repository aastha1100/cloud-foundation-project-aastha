## Descriptive Analysis  
**Project Title:** Data Analytic Platform (DAP) Implementation for Vancouver Water Distribution System  
**Objective:** Design and implement a cloud-based DAP to analyze water distribution pipe age and material composition enabling proactive maintenance prioritization.  

**Background:**  
The City of Vancouver‚Äôs Water Distribution Department manages aging infrastructure including 60,000+ water mains. Frequent pipe failures for instance leaks bursts necessitated a data-driven approach to identify high-risk pipes. The DAP aimed to:  
- Calculate pipe age from installation dates.  
- Correlate material types with failure risks.  
- Provide actionable insights for resource allocation.  

**Dataset:**  
- **Water Distribution Mains Dataset**:  
  - Fields: `INSTALLATION_DATE` `MATERIAL_INFO` `PIPE_DIAMETER`.  
  - `INSTALLATION_DATE`: Pipe installation date in DD/MM/YYYY format.  
  - `MATERIAL_INFO`: Material type used for instance cast iron copper ductile iron.  
  - Size: 60,000+ records.  
  - Accuracy: Survey-grade spatial data.  
  - Scope: Excludes residential/commercial connections.

**Methodology:**  
1. **Data Collection & Preparation**:  
   - Load the dataset to python to do initial cleaning and calculate age of pipe. New column added `Pipe_Age`.  
   - Segregate the data using pandas to three datasets `installation_dates` `material_info` `pipe_diameter`.  
   - **Ingestion**: Uploaded raw CSV files (`installation_dates` `material_info` `pipe_diameter`) to dedicated **Amazon S3 buckets**.

   - **Segregation**: Organized data by logical categories (e.g. installation dates) for schema-on-read flexibility.  
3. **Descriptive Statistics**:  
   - **Age Calculation**: Used **AWS Athena** SQL queries to compute average pipe age (45 years) and identify 12,083 pipes >70 years old.  
   - **Material Analysis**: Grouped data by `MATERIAL_INFO`; 11,947 aging cast iron pipes were flagged as high-risk.  
4. **Data Visualization**:  
   - **ETL Workflows**: Joined tables in **AWS Glue Visual ETL** to create a unified dataset (`Final-output`).  
   - **Risk Mapping**: Generated summaries (e.g. material-to-age correlations) for prioritization.  

**Tools & Technologies**:  
- **AWS S3** (storage versioning encryption).  
- **AWS Glue** (cataloging ETL jobs Visual ETL joins).  
- **AWS Athena** (SQL queries for material prevalence).  
- **AWS Glue Databrew** (data profiling/cleaning).  
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk/EC2** (scalable processing).  
- **AWS CloudWatch/CloudTrail** (monitoring/auditing).

**Deliverables**:  
1. **Risk Assessment Report**: Highlighted 11,947 high-risk cast iron pipes needing replacement.  
2. **Cleaned Dataset**: 20,000 records post-cleaning.

6. **Cost Analysis**: Platform operational cost: **USD 1.32 annually**.

**Timeline**:  
- **4 weeks** (Data ingestion ‚Üí Cleaning ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Reporting).

## Diagnostic Analysis  
**Project Title:** Root Cause Analysis of Cast Iron Pipe Failures  
**Objective:** Diagnose why cast iron pipes contribute disproportionately to failures.  

**Methodology**:  
1. **Correlation Analysis**:  
   - Linked pipe age (`INSTALLATION_DATE`) and material degradation using **AWS Glue ETL jobs**.  
   - Identified 98.8% of pipes >70 years old as cast iron.  
2. **Root Cause Validation**:  
   - Cross-referenced findings with corrosion studies (Rajani & Kleiner,2001).  
   - Validated via **AWS Athena** queries.  

**Tools & Technologies**:  
- **AWS Glue** (material-age mapping).  
- **AWS Athena** (diagnostic SQL queries).  

**Deliverables**:  
- Technical report linking cast iron corrosion to failure rates.  
- Athena query outputs.

## Data Wrangling  
**Project Title:** Pipeline Engineering for Water Infrastructure Data  
**Objective:** Clean, transform, and catalog pipe data for analytics.  

**Methodology**:  
1. **Data Profiling**:  
   - Used **AWS Glue Databrew** to detect missing values (e.g. null `INSTALLATION_DATE`).  
2. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Removed 40,000+ outliers/null records. Standardized date formats.  
3. **Transformation**:  
   - Cataloged data into **AWS Glue** tables (`van_wat_dist_trf_system`).  

**Deliverables**:  
- Cleaned dataset (20,000 records) in S3.  
- Glue DataBrew job profiles.  

## Data Quality Control
**Project Title:** Ensuring Data Integrity for Water Analytics  
**Objective:** Implement security, validation, and governance measures.  

**Methodology**:  
1. **Validation**:  
   - Applied **AWS Glue Data Quality** rules to flag incomplete `MATERIAL_INFO`.  
2. **Security**:  
   - Enabled S3 server-side encryption (SSE) and versioning.
